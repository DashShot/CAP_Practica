I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light
that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the
realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Nightâ€™s Watch, for this night and all
the nights to come.

73-I am the watcher on the walls.
17-I am the fire that burns again
13-st the cold, the light that br
29-ings the dawn, the horn that w
23-akes the sleepers, the shield
61-that guards the realms of men.
17-I pledge my life and honor to
83-the Night's Watch, for this ni
41-ght and all the nights to come
